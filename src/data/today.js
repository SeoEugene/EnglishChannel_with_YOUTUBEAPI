        desc: "Today we take Mr. Z on a culinary adventure with a genuine farm-to-table Korean meal. Or shall I say history-to-table?! Ojina has one of the most extensive collection of Korean food ingredients and sauces in the world and it was such a blessing to get a tour around the farm and try the food ourselves. This was a first even for me: trying a 130 year old soy sauce, 10 year old kimchi, on top of a full 16 course Korean meal! Hope you guys enjoy the video! A big thank you to The Kia EV9 for sponsoring this video! And also thanks to Hwang Hyo Jin and everyone at OJINA, and Austin for giving us an amazing culinary experience!",
